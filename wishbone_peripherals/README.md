All peripherals are clients. All listed items build on the one listed below:
- wb_softmax: Add SoftMax
- wb_activation: Add ReLU
- wb_sigmoid: Add Sigmoid
- wb_pooling: Add 2x2 MaxPooling and 2x2 Average Pooling
- wb_tensor_arithmetic: Demonstrates rough NPU design. Supports basic add and subtract between three tensors and stores the result in the result tensor
- wb_buttons_leds: Basic Wishboine communication (converted from Verilog: https://github.com/mattvenn/wishbone_buttons_leds/tree/caravel)
